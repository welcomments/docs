Hiiiiiiii there! ðŸ‘‹

You've just found your way into our documentation.
Just like the owner's manual for a new car, most of the time, you don't need to even open it. 

But it does come very handy when you get stuck in the middle of the desert. Or like when our integration experience gives you lemons, but you don't know how to make lemonade out of it. 

Luckily, we took some time to write some instructions and common gotchas for you so that you don't have to bang your head to the wall and be left wondering what are the correct steps for the rain dance to make Welcomments work on your website.

**These docs are a work in progress.** If there's something that is unclear or missing, be sure to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/welcomments/docs/issues/new) or reach out to us at [hello@welcomments.io](mailto:hello@welcomments.io).
